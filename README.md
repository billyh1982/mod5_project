INSTRUCTIONS: In VS Code, complete the following tasks in your .html and .css files.

Part 1: Bootstrap Website
Goal: Create a responsive and well-structured website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
Requirements:
Navigation Bar
Add a navbar with at least 3 links (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
Ensure the navbar is responsive across different screen sizes (consider using Bootstrap’s built-in responsiveness).
Home Page
Build a homepage that matches the feel of the website you’re emulating.
Include headings, images, and a hero section to introduce the site.
Form Section
Add a form for user input.
Examples:
Contact form
Sign-up form
Booking form
Use at least two different input types (e.g., text, email, number, or date).
Table 
Include a table to display relevant information.
Examples:
Event schedule
Product comparison
Price list
3 Bootstrap Components 
Choose any three Bootstrap components that suit your website.
Examples:
Cards to display projects or products
Carousel to rotate images
Modals for pop-ups
Accordions for FAQs
Integrate the components effectively to enhance the design of your site.

Part 2: JavaScript Functions
Goal:
Write JavaScript functions in a separate .js file to simulate interactive features you might add to your site in the future. Focus on using variables, functions, arrays, and strings.
Your functions do not need to be connected to the website at this stage.
